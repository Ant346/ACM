In this assignment you will need to implement some crucial parts of optimization-based controller.

Pay attantion to comments behind the cells in the notebook, to prevent problems with preparation of the playground.

If you're struggling with that, you can find this assignment on [Google Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QyA_G1OX1WG9wGdq8RDsKskGvsnYAFkR/view?usp=share_link)
